Hereâ€™s a concise description:

Developed an advanced OOP-based Library Management System in Java.
Utilized OOP principles including:
Inheritance for Admin and Member roles.
Encapsulation with private fields and getter/setter methods.
Polymorphism through method overloading and overriding.
Abstraction via an interface for library operations.
Composition for Member-LibraryCard relationships.
Aggregation for representing Library branches.
Implemented:
Singleton Design Pattern for a globally accessible Library instance.
Static Members to track system-wide statistics like issued books.
Exception Handling with custom exceptions for error management.
Designed a menu-driven interactive system for real-time user operations, ensuring robustness, scalability, and usability.
